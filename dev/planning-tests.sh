# planning-tests.sh — fixture-based negative-test harness for BOTH of this repo's discovery
# scripts, bin/find-planning-work.sh (#164) and, since #176, bin/find-implementation-work.sh too
# — not this repo's own gate (that's dev/selfcheck.sh + dev/selfcheck-tests.sh) and not the
# consumer doctor's harness (dev/doctor-tests.sh). Builds throwaway fixture directories under
# mktemp, with a stub `gh` on PATH, and runs the REAL script under test against each, pinning:
#
#   bin/find-planning-work.sh (#164, planner-facing): only a comment whose authorAssociation is
#   OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR ever puts its issue into needs_revision or is honoured as the
#   latest plan comment; everything else (CONTRIBUTOR, NONE, or a comment with no
#   authorAssociation field at all — fail-closed) posted after the issue's latest trusted plan
#   (or any such comment, if there is no trusted plan yet) is reported in the untrusted_comments
#   output bucket instead of being silently dropped or silently trusted, and never shadows a
#   real, trusted plan; one posted before that plan is dropped with no bucket entry. #176 added
#   issue-author provenance on the SAME script: every needs_initial_plan/needs_revision item now
#   carries {author, association, trusted_author}, a non-maintainer-authored issue is still
#   listed (planning is not gated on it) but also appears in the untrusted_issue_authors bucket,
#   and if the installed gh can't return issue-level authorAssociation the whole run fails closed
#   (every issue untrusted, one warn line, counts.author_association_unavailable: true).
#
#   bin/find-implementation-work.sh (#176, implementer-facing): the same trust gate, reused
#   rather than forked (TRUSTED_ASSOCIATIONS agrees with find-planning-work.sh's — see gate
#   assertion 4.26), selects each ready issue's approved plan comment and its binding post-plan
#   comments itself: a plan-marker comment from an untrusted author is never selected as `plan`;
#   an untrusted post-plan comment never lands in trusted_post_plan; a trusted post-plan comment
#   opening "<!-- verifier-verdict -->" (the orchestrator's own archive) is excluded from
#   trusted_post_plan too; a comment with no authorAssociation field at all is fail-closed
#   untrusted; and an issue with no trusted plan comment yields plan: null but stays in `ready`.
#   #174 added plan-binding provenance on the SAME script: each plan_selection entry's
#   `approval.covers_plan` is true iff the newest `plan-approved` labeling event is not earlier
#   than the selected plan comment (a plan posted AFTER the label is not covered — the issue's
#   named failure), the newest of several relabel events wins, ties count as covered, an
#   unreadable events lookup fails closed (`covers_plan: null`), and `binding_line` is non-null
#   iff `covers_plan` is `true`. Also pins `--issue <n>` single-issue mode's output shape and its
#   exit-2 argument validation.
#
# Usage: bash dev/planning-tests.sh [name-filter] — same output contract as
# dev/cleanup-tests.sh, dev/doctor-tests.sh, and dev/selfcheck-tests.sh: one PASS/FAIL line per
# case, a `== summary: N pass, M fail ==` footer, exit 0 iff nothing failed; a filter with no
# match exits 1.
#
# Every write happens under one `mktemp -d` root, removed via an EXIT trap. No git fixture is
# needed — neither script calls anything but `gh` and `jq` — so each fixture is just a directory
# holding a stub `gh` (offline, deterministic) plus the JSON payloads it serves:
#   - initial.json           : the needs_initial_plan query's response (find-planning-work.sh)
#   - candidates.txt         : the revision candidates query's response — one issue number per
#                               line, exactly what `gh issue list --jq '.[].number'` would print
#                               (find-planning-work.sh)
#   - ready.json              : the ready-issues query's response (find-implementation-work.sh)
#   - issue-<n>.json          : the `gh issue view` payload for candidate/ready issue <n>, shared
#                               by both scripts (each fixture directory is dedicated to ONE
#                               script under test, so there's no naming collision); a candidate
#                               or ready issue with no issue-<n>.json file simulates a failed
#                               `gh issue view`, exercising the fetch-failures path
#   - reject-association      : (optional, presence-only) makes the stub's authorAssociation-
#                               bearing `gh issue list` call exit 1, exercising
#                               find-planning-work.sh's fail-closed fallback
#   - events-<n>.json          : (#174) the `gh api .../issues/<n>/events` payload for ready
#                               issue <n> — a plain JSON array of GitHub issue-event objects
#                               ({event, label:{name}, created_at, actor:{login}}); absent means
#                               no plan-approved labeling event, degrading to
#                               reason: no-approval-event rather than a hard failure
#   - reject-events-<n>        : (optional, presence-only, #174) makes the stub's `gh api` call
#                               for ready issue <n>'s events exit 1, exercising
#                               find-implementation-work.sh's fail-closed approval-unreadable path
# The stub tells find-planning-work.sh's two `gh issue list` calls apart, in order: a call
# whose args contain "authorAssociation" (the needs_initial_plan query, now requesting the new
# field) is served from initial.json, or made to fail if reject-association is present; a call
# containing "pr-open" (find-implementation-work.sh's ready query — neither planning search
# contains this token) is served from ready.json; a call containing "--jq" (the revision
# candidates query) is served from candidates.txt; anything else (find-planning-work.sh's
# fallback needs_initial_plan retry, which also lacks "authorAssociation") falls through to
# initial.json too. Discriminating by `-label:`/`label:` search-string prefix would be wrong —
# `-label:plan-proposed` contains `label:plan-proposed` as a substring.
