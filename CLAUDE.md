# CLAUDE.md — trail-blazer-flow (the harness itself)

This repo **is** the Claude Code plugin (the harness), not a project that consumes it. The
README is the canonical spec; this file governs work **on** the harness's own code, docs, and
scripts — not the contract this harness expects of a *consumer* repo's `CLAUDE.md` (see the
README's "The CLAUDE.md contract" for that).

## Setup

Nothing to install. Requires `bash` and `jq` on the PATH. `gh` is only needed if you're running
the harness's own `bin/*.sh` scripts against a live GitHub repo — it is not required for the
verification gate below.

## Verification

The authoritative gate is one command, run from the repo root:

```bash
bash dev/selfcheck.sh
```

It prints a `PASS`/`FAIL` line per assertion (grouped and labelled in its own output) and a
`== summary: N pass, M fail ==` footer, and exits 0 iff nothing failed. The same command runs in
CI on every pull request (`.github/workflows/selfcheck.yml`, two jobs — `selfcheck` on
`ubuntu-latest` and `selfcheck-macos` on `macos-latest`, which prepends `/bin` to `PATH` so the
same commands run under Apple's bash 3.2 instead of a newer bash); a red check means one of the
jobs' four commands failed — reproduce locally with `bash dev/selfcheck.sh`,
`bash dev/selfcheck-tests.sh`, `bash dev/doctor-tests.sh`, and `bash dev/cleanup-tests.sh` (on a
Mac, prefix each with `PATH=/bin:$PATH` to match the macOS job's shell, e.g.
`PATH=/bin:$PATH bash dev/selfcheck.sh`).
There is no test suite and no build step: this repo is Markdown instruction files, Bash scripts,
and JSON manifests. The gate prints what it checks — run it. A change the gate can't catch needs
a new assertion in the gate, not a waiver, subject to the machine-parsed-artifacts rule below.

`dev/selfcheck-tests.sh` is the gate's own negative-test harness — a separate script, not part
of the gate itself, that copies this repo to a throwaway temp directory, applies one documented
perturbation per case, and asserts the gate fails with exactly the expected assertion id(s). It
also runs in CI, as the second step in each job; run it by hand
(`bash dev/selfcheck-tests.sh`) whenever `dev/selfcheck.sh` changes, and add a case for any
assertion that parses structure out of a file, compares two extracted sets, or exercises script
behavior; fixed-string and numeric-threshold assertions may ship without one, listed in the
harness's exempt comment with a one-line reason each.

`dev/doctor-tests.sh` is a separate negative-test harness for the *consumer* doctor
(`bin/check-harness.sh`): it builds throwaway fixture repos under `mktemp` and pins verdicts
(the settings.json block, template-diff, the ratchet's never-execute guarantee, merge-autonomy
activation, default-branch guard coverage, the post-merge-verification declaration state —
declared/no-fence/not-declared, fence-aware and depth-aware, printing only an integer count of
fenced command lines — and a path-qualified verification interpreter such as
`<repo>/api/.venv/bin/python` being checked against a literal-path allow entry distinct from the
bare-name regex check) that would otherwise only be hand-verified. It runs in CI as the third
step, but it is not part of `dev/selfcheck.sh` itself — run it by hand whenever
`bin/check-harness.sh` changes.

`dev/cleanup-tests.sh` is a separate negative-test harness for `bin/cleanup-after-merge.sh`: it
builds throwaway fixture git repos under `mktemp`, with a stub `gh` and stub `git` on `PATH`, and
runs the real script against them to pin the multi-PR `KEEP` behavior (a merged PR that is only
"Part of #n", an open sibling PR, or a `<!-- harness-multi-pr -->` marker must leave the issue
open and never call `gh issue close`), the ordinary close path, the `--ff-only` pull failure
continuing instead of aborting, and the pre-flight `gh repo view` / `git branch --show-current` /
`gh pr list` lookup failures each being reported (WARN) and survived rather than aborting the
script before any output. It runs in CI as the fourth step, but it is not part of
`dev/selfcheck.sh` itself — run it by hand whenever `bin/cleanup-after-merge.sh` changes.

This repo deliberately does **not** aim to pass `bin/check-harness.sh` — that script is the
*consumer* doctor; see the README's "Working on the harness itself" for why.

## Conventions

- **Plugin/consumer boundary**: nothing project-specific belongs in `agents/` or `skills/` —
  that content belongs in a *consumer* repo's `CLAUDE.md`/`LESSONS.md` instead. See the README's
  "Distribution".
- `bin/` is on consumers' Bash PATH; every `bin/*.sh` needs a matching allow entry in
  `templates/repo-settings.json` (the gate's bijection assertion checks this). Scripts meant
  only for developing this repo (not for consumers) go in `dev/` instead.
- **Gate assertions compare machine-parsed artifacts only.** An assertion may only compare two
  mechanically extracted artifacts (JSON↔JSON, script↔script, script↔JSON, filename↔frontmatter);
  no assertion may parse or pin English prose. Duplicated spec text is resolved by **deleting a
  copy**, never by pinning both — pinning makes the duplication load-bearing and permanent.
- **Follow-ups must name a user-visible failure.** A follow-up issue filed from a PR must name a
  concrete failure a user of this plugin would experience; a verifier's "Notes for the PR
  reviewer" is not a finding and does not become a follow-up by default.
- `*.sh` files are LF-only (enforced by `.gitattributes`) and must stay portable across BSD
  (macOS) and Git-Bash userlands — no GNU-only flags (`sed -i` without a suffix, `grep -P`,
  `readlink -f`, `mapfile`/`readarray`, `declare -A`). Enforced mechanically on `bin/*.sh`
  (assertion 1.4); `dev/*.sh` follows the same rule by convention, and is exercised under
  BSD/bash 3.2 by the `selfcheck-macos` CI job.
- The README is part of "done": every factual claim it makes about this repo's behavior must be
  checkable against the code (the verifier's Documentation changes check applies to docs).
- Release ritual: bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and create the matching
  `vX.Y.Z` annotated tag, in the same commit — see the README's "Updating".
